                         <p>B. Don't use initials, abbreviations and codes that are not commonly understood.</p>
                         <p>C. Avoid using common words such as ‘draft’ or ‘letter’ at the start of file names, unless doing so will make it easier to retrieve the record.</p>

You and John from UX worked on it, I think? We are thinking about picking it back up again.”</p>
                         <p>For me, requests like this always used to result in a moment of dread followed by a wasted day searching through old files. That is, until I learned how to avoid all that stress and wasted time. How? With organized file and folder structures.</p>

                         <h2>An Intro to Folder Structures</h2>
                         <p>Organizing files on your computer is just like organizing anything else. Say you want to organize your clothes. You might sort each type of clothes into separate stacks. Then you might pair the socks or group all the shirts by color.</p>
                         <p>Or, you could throw everything into one drawer and <em>hope</em> you can find the right pair of socks when you need it. And that's how we typically treat our files: we save files randomly to our Desktop and Documents folders, then waste time searching for files every day.</p>
                         <p>Folder structures can help, just like drawers and dividers can keep your clothes organized. A folder structure is the way folders are organized on your computer. As folders are added over time, you can either keep them at the same level—like Folders 1, 2, and 3 in the chart below—or nest them within each other for a hierarchy—like Sub folders 1B and 1B-1 below. Nested folders generally make it easier to find specific files later, because you don’t have to sift through all your files at once.</p>
                         <p>Picture a file cabinet, with three drawers, and several folders in each one—that's how this folder structure would look in real life. Here’s how that same folder structure would look on a computer if you view your files and folders in List mode:</p>
                         <p>Folders and sub folders like these can keep your files organized in a logical way. It’s easy to get into a trap of creating a subfolder for everything. If you have 15 sub folders under every folder, though, you might want to reconsider your strategy. At this point, subfolders stop being helpful and start causing workflow problems.</p>
                         <h3>What Makes a Good Folder Structure?</h3>
                         <p>The best folder structure is the one that mimics the way you work. Do you plan important tasks by quarter? A new folder for each quarter's work might be good. Or do you work around projects? Consider new folders for each project.</p>
                         <p>Browsing through your folders and finding files should be intuitive. If your method of organization is tedious, it’s going to be tough for the rest of your team to follow along. For company projects, pick something that works well for everyone in the team, since everyone may not search for a file or folder in the same way you do. If you want to maintain your folder structure long-term, you’ll want to make sure everyone understands (and hopefully likes!) the system.</p>
                         <p>There’s no file management silver bullet, but there are a few tricks to help your file structure be successful.:</p>
                         <ul>
                         <li><strong>Think of folder names as keywords:</strong> Keep in mind that you can search for files using folder names; the more specific, the more quickly you’ll find what you’re looking for.</li>
                         <li><strong>Keep folders unique:</strong> Make sure there’s no overlap in what goes into your folders (e.g., there shouldn’t be two places you’re keeping invoices for the same project).</li>
                         <li><strong>Make a cheat sheet:</strong> It’s OK if you don’t have every single folder memorized. There’s no shame in saving a flow chart for quick reference.</li>

                         <p>The first step to building an effective folder structure is figuring out your top-level folder. Do you want to simply make a new folder for every new project? Or perhaps you could organize by time, with folders and sub folders for each year and month? Maybe you work on a couple different types of projects, and could organize based on those types (e.g., copywriters might work on advertisements, blogs, emails, and landing pages, while graphic designers may divide tasks by medium, like print or digital)?</p>
                         <p>Once you’ve worked out your top-level folder, it’s time to organize your sub folders. Here are some strategies I’ve used in the past:</p>
                         <h3>1. “Working,” “final,” and “archive” sub folders</h3>
                         <p>For this example, let’s assume the top-level folders have already been organized by year then project type. You can see from the screenshot that we’re looking at the year 2016, and the main projects are advertisements, blog posts, customer emails, and landing pages. Those are the four categories in which you’ll put your different projects or tasks.</p>
                         <p>Inside the "advertisements" folder, I have three tasks listed. Here’s where I put Edward Smith’s tips to use. For each task, I used the folder name to describe the due date (mmyy), type of project (pay per click or PPC, in this case), and which product the task is focused on. These folder names act as both keyword tags and add an extra level of organization. If you sort the folders by name, they’ll automatically be ordered by date due then project type. If you search by product name or ad type, your folders should pop up easily.</p>
                         <p>Inside the “0116 PPC product x” folder is where you’ll find all the working, final, and archive files that have to do with January 2016 pay per click ads focused on product X.</p>
                         <p>Here’s how the working/final/archive system should work:</p>
                         <ul>
                         <li><strong>Working:</strong> Anything you’re currently working on. In this example, this folder might contain any ad copy, banner designs, or targeting information for the January PPC campaign that hasn’t yet been finalized. This is also a good place to keep native or source files.</li>
                         <li><strong>Final:</strong> Anything ready for public consumption. Don’t put files into the final folder until they’ve been completely approved and no more changes will be made to them. In this example, the final folder would only contain ads ready to be posted live.</li>
                         <li><strong>Archive:</strong> Anything that doesn’t fit into your working or final folder. Put your notes, brainstorms, research, and other miscellaneous info in here. Any false starts can be dropped in here too if you change direction mid-project. A false start, in this case, might be an ad concept you started working on but later got scrapped completely. Don’t clutter up your working folders with files that will never be considered “final;” throw them in the archive instead.</li>
                         </ul>
                         <p>This folder structure is particularly useful if you’re working on a project with multiple pieces. In this example, you’d most likely be creating more than one PPC ad at once. This system also works well for teams working on a project where several people are working on the same deliverable. The person who writes and designs the ads, in this instance, likely won't also post the ads. If that’s the case, the person posting the ad will know when files are ready to go live by checking the final folder. They won’t have to ask the ad creator whether they’re ready or not, saving everyone time.</p>
                         <p>Putting it all together, here’s what you’re full structure should look like:</p>
                         <h3>2. “To review” and “from review” sub folders</h3>
                         <p>This strategy starts with the same top-level folders as the example above, but instead focuses on keeping all the versions of a file intact. For example, in the "blog posts" folder, I saved three different posts. These posts are arranged by publish date (mmyy) and named by post topic, rather than by blog post title since titles often change.</p>
                         <p>Within the “0216 topic a” folder, the “to review/from review” folder structure comes into play. This structure works really well with files that will be going through many rounds of edits. I used this folder structure while working in publishing to keep track of all the rounds of editing, typesetting, and proofing that goes into a finished book.</p>
                         <p>I keep track of each draft of the blog post by saving it to either a “to review” or “from review” folder, meaning that the draft was last edited by me (“to review”) or by my editor (“from review”). This helps eliminate confusion around the draft number (I edited the blog post three times, but my editor edited twice). I’ve also named every file in this folder with “v1” or “v2” according to version.</p>
                         <p>Here’s how this structure works:</p>
                         <ul>
                         <li><strong>01 - draft (to review):</strong> By default, your first draft won’t have been reviewed by anyone yet. Whatever you’re working on (blog post, graphic design project, documentation, etc.), put your first draft in this folder. Name your file with a v1 at the end, so anyone who comes across the file later will be able to tell it’s a first draft. When you’re ready, send that draft to whoever has to review it.</li>
                         <li><strong>02 - first edit (from review):</strong> When your editors send their feedback on that draft, put it in this folder. Keep the file name the same, but add the initials of the editor onto the end. In this example, I’m using my own initials: topic-a-blog-text-v1-CNB means that CNB has edited version 1 of this draft. Don’t do anything else with the file; leave it as is, with every edit intact. By doing this, you’ll always have a record of what edits were requested, by whom, and you’ll be able to cross reference to make sure every edit was incorporated into the second draft.</li>
                         <li><strong>03 - second draft (to review):</strong> Copy and paste the file from the “02 - first edit (from review)” folder into this folder. Change the file name to include v2 on the end and remove the initials. This will become your second draft. Open the file, make your edits, and send your file back out for review.</li>
                         <li><strong>04 - second edit (from review):</strong> This folder functions the same way as the “02 - first edit (from review)” folder. Because the number of reviews and drafts your file goes through can vary, repeat this folder structure as many times as necessary.</li>
                         <li><strong>05 - final version (sent to publish):</strong> When edits are complete, put your final draft here. Looking back on your folders later, this will help quickly find the final version of the file.</li>
                         <li><strong>z - archive:</strong> You can put all the files that didn’t fit into the above sub folders here.</li>
                         </ul>
                         <h3>3. “Year” or “client” folders</h3>
                         <p>If your Desktop houses hundreds of files, all related to work for just a few clients, creating folders for each client might be your best bet. Or if you have an overwhelming number of receipts for business expenses, sorting them in folders by year or month could be the simple structure you need. More folders aren’t always better! However simple, find a system that works for you, and then stick with it. Consistency is what will help you stay organized in the long run.</p>
                         <h3>4. Tagging</h3>
                         <p>Instead of—or in addition to—folder structures, try tagging files. The benefit of tagging is the ability to add multiple tags to a file, such as tagging an invoice for Client XYZ with an "invoice" tag and a “Client XYZ” tag. Then you can see all invoices together or all files related to “Client XYZ” together, depending on your query.</p>
                         <p>Academic and researcher William Gunn points out the convenience of tagging on the <a href="http://blog.mendeley.com/2010/12/17/searching-vs-filing-managing-your-library-the-modern-way-with-tags-and-filters/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mendeley blog</a>: "With tags, you don’t have to pick an organization scheme up front." Answering questions such as “Will year go underneath or on top of department?” become unnecessary because you can add both “year” and “department” tags to the file, and still easily find it. For example, if you’re working on a report for the logistics department that covers all orders made in May 2015. You could store the report within a folder structure like this:</p>
                         <p>Or you could simply add “department,” “report type,” and “date” tags to the file and avoid folders altogether, like this:</p>
                         <p>So when you want to find this file again, you can search for it by tags:</p>
                         <p>The key to tagging is to tag every new file immediately and consistently. Without a folder structure to fall back on, tags are all that’s keeping your files from getting lost in chaos.</p>
                         <p>Tags work on any file on a Mac running OS X Mavericks or newer. On a Windows PC, tags are supported on some file types, and can be added in a comma-separated list via the file properties pane.</p>
                         <h2>How to Make Great File Names</h2>
                         <p>Organizing your folder structure is only half the battle. Keeping your computer organized will also require tidying up your file names.</p>
                         <p>Files are made up of two components: the name (whatever you decide to call it) and the file extension (the type of file, like <code>.mp3</code> or <code>.docx</code>). You typically don't need to worry about file extensions; they're set by the programs you use, and typically hidden by default on most computers. But you should take control of the file name. The best file name is one that explains what’s in the file, without you having to open it.</p>
                         <ul>
                         <li><strong>Unique:</strong> It’s impossible to tell what’s in a file if you have many with the same name.</li>
                         <li><strong>Indicative of what the file contains:</strong> Is your file an annual report? Research? A to-do list? Put that information in the file name. Consider what recipients’ first reactions will be if you email a file to them; best to keep all the identifying information right in the file name, so anyone receiving the file is clear about what’s in it.</li>
                         <li><strong>In line with your business structure:</strong> This goes right along with your folder structure. Does your business think of tasks based on which client they’re for or what month something is due?</li>
                         <li><strong>Scannable:</strong> Make sure anyone who quickly glances at the file will understand its name. Don’t use any abbreviations that aren’t common knowledge or long streams of letters and numbers without any delineation between them. Including spaces doesn’t always work, but you can use underscores, hyphens, or camel case to make your file names easier on the eyes. Here's an example:</li>
                         </ul>
                         <p>Beyond making your file names unique, scannable, and easily understood, these tips for good file names:</p>
                         <ul>
                         <li><strong>Dates:</strong> Always write dates in <code>yyyymmdd</code> or <code>yymmdd</code> format, so your files will naturally fall in chronological order. This rule is useful, but it’s not hard and fast. In my examples above, I used mmyy because the folders were already organized by year making month the most important descriptor.</li>
                         <li><strong>Length:</strong> Be aware that some software programs have character limits on file names. Include only necessary information in your names, and cut anything superfluous (e.g., words like “a,” “and,” or “the”).</li>
                         <li><strong>Special characters:</strong> Not every program will accept or understand special characters, so avoid using any of these in file names: <code>~ ! @ # $ % ^ &amp; * ( ) ` ; &lt; &gt; ? , [ ] { } ' " | .</code></li>
                         <li><strong>Sequential files:</strong> If you’re naming files that go in an order, use leading zeros (01, 02, 03 instead of 1, 2, 3). This ensures your files (or folders) will stay lined up how you want them too.</li>
                         </ul>
                         <ul>
                         <li><strong>Find balance:</strong> Only you can decide what’s too much or too little in a name.</li>
                         <li><strong>Document your system:</strong> Create a cheat sheet of any abbreviations you’ll often use or any rules you may forget.</li>
                         <li><strong>Start general then get specific:</strong> Since your filenames will naturally be sorted from whatever you type first, start with the most general components (year, department, client, etc.) then move onto the specifics (project title, ID, version, etc.). A general rule of thumb is whatever you want to see first, write first.</li>
                         </ul>
                         <h2>How to Quickly Find Files Get Your Files Organized Today</h2>
                         <p>If your files and folders are already disorganized—it will take forever to clean up. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither will your new file structure. So start out with this month's files, for example. Then save every new file according to that folder structure.</p>
                         <p>Consider archiving all old files by moving them into an "Old Files" or "Archive" folder. Anything you can’t see yourself needing again, throw it in there. When you have time, you can go through this “Archive” folder and store files using the same folder structure you've already started using for new files.</p>
                         <p><em>What folder structure do you use to keep your files organized? We'd love to hear about it in the comments below!</em></p>
                         <p>The principles of naming conventions can equally be applied to electronic and physical files/folders/material.</p>
                         <h2>Benefits of naming conventions</h2>
                         <p>Naming records consistently, logically and in a predictable way will distinguish similar records from one another at a glance, and by doing so will facilitate the storage and retrieval of data. Through consistency and the application of logical standards we benefit from secure storage, and the ability to locate and access information.</p>
                         <h2>File identifiability</h2>
                         <p>Good practice dictates that all information (files, datasets, documents, or records) should be identifiable and traceable. This can be achieved by following good practices by applying referencing to all documents/files.</p>
                         <p>Document/file references will include:</p>
                         <ul>
                         <li>File name, or full file path including file name</li>
                         <li>Name/role of file author(s) or originator(s)</li>
                         <li>Date of creation, edit or event which is the subject of the document/file</li>
                         <li>Version number if applicable</li>
                         </ul>
                         <p class="goodpractice">Remove spaces from file names or use punctuation such as underscores and hyphens to separate words e.g. “AHRC_TechnicalApp_Response20120925.docx” or “AHRC-TechnicalApp-Response20120925.docx” rather than “what we got back from funders about the data stuff.docx”</p>
                         <h3>Suggested file and folder naming conventions</h3>
                         <ol start="1">
                         <li>Keep file and folder names short, but meaningful.</li>
                         <li>Avoid unnecessary repetition and redundant words in file names and file paths.</li>
                         <li>Use capital letters to delimit words, not spaces.</li>
                         <li>When including a number in a file name always give it as a two-digit number rather than one, i.e. 01, 02 … 99, unless it is a year or another number with more than two digits.</li>
                         <li>If using a date in the file name always state the date ‘back to front’, and use four digit years, two digit months and two digit days: YYYYMMDD or YYYYMM or YYYY or YYYY-YYYY.</li>
                         <li>When including a personal name in a file name give the family name first followed by the initials.</li>
                         <li>Avoid using common words such as ‘draft’ or ‘letter’ at the start of file names, unless doing so will make it easier to retrieve the record.</li>
                         <li>Order the elements in a file name in the most appropriate way to retrieve the record.</li>
                         <li>The file names of records relating to recurring events should include the date and a description of the event, except where the inclusion of any of either of these elements would be incompatible with rule 2.</li>
                         <li>The file names of correspondence should include the name of the correspondent, an indication of the subject, the date of the correspondence and whether it is incoming or outgoing correspondence, except where the inclusion of any of these elements would be incompatible with rule 2.</li>
                         <li>The file name of an email attachment should include the name of the correspondent, an indication of the subject, the date of the correspondence, ‘attch’, and an indication of the number of attachments sent with the covering email, except where the inclusion of any of these elements would be incompatible with rule 2.</li>
                         <li>The version number of a record should be indicated in its file name by the inclusion of ‘d’ followed by the version number and, where applicable, ‘d’ indicating ‘draft version’.</li>
                         <li>Avoid using non-alphanumeric characters in file names.</li>
                         </ol>
                         <p>Include dates in the format YYYYMMDD. They will be easy to find and appear chronologically.<br>Don’t use excessively long folder and file names – there may be problems when backing-up, restoring or copying data.</p>
                         <h4>Good Practice and Guidance –Document Version Control</h4>
                         <h4>1. Create Document/File</h4>
                         <p>•Save the document according to file naming guidance/good practice.</p>
                         <h4>2. Document Identification</h4>
                         <p>•Identify on the document e.g. in header or footer, the author, filename, page number and date the document is created/revised.</p>
                         <h4>3. Version Control Table</h4>
                         <p>•Versions and changes documented with Version Control Table where significant/formal/project based.</p>
                         <h4>4. Version Number</h4>
                         <p>•Current version number identified on the first page and where appropriate, incorporated into the header or footer of the document.</p>
                         <p>•Version number is included as part of the file name.</p>
                         <h4>5. First Draft Version</h4>
                         <p>•Named as version “0-1” (no full stops in electronic file names).</p>
                         <p>•Subsequent draft versions 0-2, 0-3, 0-4 ...</p>
                         <h4>6. First Final/Approved Version</h4>
                         <p>•When document is final/approved it becomes version 1-0.</p>
                         <h4>7. Changes to Final Version</h4>
                         <p>•Changed/revised final version becomes x-1.</p>
                         <p>•Subsequent drafts to Final version become e.g. 1-1, 1-2, 1-3 etc.</p>
                         <h4>8. Further Final/Approved Documents</h4>
                         <p>•Version number increased by “1-0” e.g. 1-0, 2-0, 3-0 etc.</p>
                         <p>e.g. Amendments to Final 1-0 are 1-1, 1-2, 1-3 and as approved becomes 2-0.</p>
